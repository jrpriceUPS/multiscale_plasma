Known issues (BGK):
    BGK does not really support two species right now (no two-species tau)
    Plasma oscillation does not oscillate properly in BGK
    Instability in Poisson term of BGK when Nx is large (about 100 or so)

Known issues (MD):


Notes:
    Velocity resample for MD has not been tested very thoroughly
    
TODO:
    Do everything 3D
    Do everything in python
    Figure out BGK Poisson problems
    Formalize unit tests for code testing
